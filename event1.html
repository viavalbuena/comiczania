                <p class="long-description">When Dreams Come to Life<br><br>
                  As darkness falls, dazzling special effects transform the Rivers of America into an epic canvas for this extravagant live show. 

                  Fast asleep, Mickey dreams he is the Sorcerer’s Apprentice. With a wave of his hands, he conducts scenes from Fantasia across enormous screens of water while brilliant sparks burst overhead. Pink elephants, swashbuckling pirates, princesses and more appear on and around the Rivers of America.

                  When Mickey is suddenly pulled into the Magic Mirror, his dream takes a dark turn. The Evil Queen from Snow White conjures up some of Disney's most dastardly villains—including Maleficent as a 45-foot, fire-breathing dragon! Mickey must use the power of his imagination to vanquish his foes—and save the day.

                  Featuring a fantastical array of live performers, beloved Disney characters, enhanced special effects and spectacular pyrotechnics, this show will wow the entire family.
